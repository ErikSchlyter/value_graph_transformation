# ValueGraphTransformation

A simple framework for manipulating Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) for the use of
transforming models of functions and values.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'value_graph_transformation'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install value_graph_transformation

To generate diagrams for the specs in HTML format (`rake doc`) you also need to
install Graphviz[http://www.graphviz.org].

## Usage

Not finished as of yet.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
