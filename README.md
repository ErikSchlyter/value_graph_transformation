# ValueGraphTransformation

A simple framework for manipulating Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) for the use of
transforming models of functions and values.

It is written in Ruby and uses [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) for dependency
management. After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install
dependencies.

Execute `bundle exec rake doc` to generate specs and documentation. To generate
the diagrams for the specs in HTML format you also need to install
[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org).
